              I was born in Washington D.C. raised in Cincinnati Ohio, and moved to California in middle school. I am planning to move to Seattle once covid settles down and hopefully grind out the entire code fellows program. I am currently a college student taking a leap year to figure out what major I really want to pursue. I am leaning towards computer science or software engineering at the moment. Ive worked a few odd jobs, but my favorite was making a website using shopify for a local flower shop. I dream to one day become a wiz at the stock market and day trading, as well as becoming a programmer for any video game company that will take me.
