              I was born in Fairfax, VA. raised in Cincinnati Ohio, and moved to California in elementary school. Fun fact, I was at daycare in Wasington D.C. when 9/11 happened. I was a 3 year old at the time. I am planning to move to Seattle once covid settles down and hopefully grind out the entire code fellows program.
